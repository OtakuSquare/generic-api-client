    <h3>Generic API Client</h3>
</center>

This generic API client is intended to provide a simple interface to connect multiple micro services together without having to re-implement 
changes in their specification each time an endpoint changes.  
  
Otaku Square utilizes a large infrastructure of such micro services, requiring a solid way of configuring other dependant systems. This library was written to empower this by providing a way to configure services in e.g. yaml files to quickly have a up and running client ready for a developer to utilize.
